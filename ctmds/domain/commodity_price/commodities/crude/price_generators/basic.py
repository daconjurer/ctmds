    Generate oil prices taking into account seasonal patterns and typical volatility.

    Features:
    - Higher prices in winter months (heating oil demand)
    - Lower prices in spring (maintenance season)
    - Moderate prices in summer (driving season)
    - Seasonal volatility patterns
    - Random walk with mean reversion
